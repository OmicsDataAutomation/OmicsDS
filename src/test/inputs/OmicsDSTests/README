Directory with example use cases for OmicsDS
Note: as of time of writing, the workspace should be deleted before running ingestion

Example 1: ingest and export two sam files
Note: the sample name for sam files is the filename stripped of the path (e.g. toy.sam)
<path to OmicsDS build dir>/tools/omicsds_import -m human_g1k_v37.fasta.fai -w workspace -a array -f sam_list -r -s sam_map --export-sam

Example 2: ingest small matrix file and perform generic query
Note: the sample name for bed files must be specified in the header by the string 'description="[sample_name]"', see s0.bed and s1.bed
<path to OmicsDS build dir>/tools/omicsds_import -m human_g1k_v37.fasta.fai -w workspace -a array -f small_list -s small_map -i -g --gene-mapping-file map_ends.gbed
